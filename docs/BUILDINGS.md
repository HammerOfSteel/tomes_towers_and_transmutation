# Buildings — Procedural DNA Catalog

> **Architecture:** Every building is described by a `BuildingDNA` object.
> The `buildBuilding(dna)` function renders it from Three.js primitives with no external assets.
> Same DNA → identical building every time (deterministic via `seed`).

## Combinatorial variety examples

One `BuildingKind` × multiple styles produces very different results:

**Watchtower across factions:**
- `stone` + human → Norman round tower, battlements
- `stone` + vampiric → black obsidian spire, gargoyles
- `arcane` + celestial → white beacon, glowing apex
- `dwarven` + dwarven → squat granite block, carved face
- `timber` + vulperia → narrow, many arrow-slits, wooden
- `elven` → spiralling organic column, no battlements, open top
- `nordic` → stave-church-style wooden, turf base

**Cottage across factions:**
- `thatched` + human → English cottage, flowers
- `stone` + human → moorland croft, tiny windows
- `elven` → vine-covered, curved walls, leaf windows
- `dwarven` → half-buried, carved stone, single round window
- `vampiric` → barred windows, heavy lock, dark render
- `nomadic` + slime → translucent dome, iridescent glow
