# Demo Release Plan — Tomes, Towers & Transmutation
> Branch: `DEMO_RELEASE`
> Goal: A **complete, polished alpha build** ready for public playtesting, a Kickstarter campaign, and an itch.io/Steam early-access launch.
> Last updated: 2026-07-18 (princess creator integrated from feature/princess-creator)

---

## PHASE PC — Princess Creator Game Integration
> **Goal:** The Spore-style Princess Atelier becomes a first-class way to start a new game.
> The existing real-model picker remains; a toggle on the new-game card switches between modes.

### PC1 — Base Templates (4 playable species)
Pre-built DNA for the 4 main species so there's always something in the library even on first launch.

- [x] `src/princess-creator/defaults/human.princess.json` — `PrincessDefaults.ts` contains HUMAN default DNA
- [x] `src/princess-creator/defaults/undead.princess.json` — UNDEAD default in PrincessDefaults.ts
- [x] `src/princess-creator/defaults/foxling.princess.json` — FOXLING default in PrincessDefaults.ts
- [x] `src/princess-creator/defaults/slime.princess.json` — SLIME default in PrincessDefaults.ts
- [x] `PrincessDefaults.ts`: exports `DEFAULT_PRINCESSES` + `PRINCESS_SPECIES_MAP`; `seedGalleryIfEmpty()` seeds on first launch

### PC2 — Princess Library UI
Shown in the new-game flow when custom mode is enabled.

- [x] `PrincessLibraryPanel.ts` — 3-column grid, thumbnail/name/species badge, Play/Edit/Delete, Create New button, seeded from defaults
- [x] Seeded with `DEFAULT_PRINCESSES` on first launch via `seedGalleryIfEmpty()`
- [x] "Edit" deep-links into the Atelier via `princess-creator.html#code=P2.xxx`

### PC3 — New-Game Custom Princess Toggle
- [x] `customPrincess: boolean` toggle on new-game card (default off, persists to `ttt_custom_princess_mode`)
- [x] `CharacterConfig.princessDna?: PrincessDNA` + `princessSpecies?` — set when custom mode on
- [x] New game flow: `princessDna` → `player.applyPrincess(dna)`, bypassing GLB model
- [x] Species mapping: `PRINCESS_SPECIES_MAP` routes all 21 princess species to 7 game species

### PC4 — Wire `buildPrincess` into Player Model
- [x] `PlayerController.applyPrincess(dna)` — dynamic import `buildPrincess`, attaches root, positions at capsule bottom
- [x] Game loop: `player.updatePrincess(t, dt)` each frame when `hasPrincess`
- [x] On new game: `princessDna` path routes before assetModel/DNA
- [x] Species mapping applied; abilities/talent/story use mapped game species

### PC5 — Atelier Dev Lab Entry
- [x] Dev Labs menu: "👸 Princess Atelier" → opens `princess-creator.html` in new tab (PauseMenu.ts)
- [x] Creative mode skin picker: show custom-princess gallery entries as "👸 Custom" tab — loads gallery, apply via `player.applyPrincess()`
- [x] `window.__game.buildPrincess(dna|code)` — exposed on debug object

### PC6 — Unit Tests
- [x] `tests/princess-creator/defaults.test.ts` — 16 tests: 4 defaults × sanitizeDna/buildPrincess/height
- [x] Run all existing `src/princess-creator/__tests__/` — 182 passing

---


> **⚠️ NO EXTERNAL MODELS — EVER.** This game is code-first, procedural-only. Zero GLB/FBX/OBJ files will be used in any game path. All geometry is `THREE.BufferGeometry` primitives via the DNA builder system. See **PROC-E** for the retirement plan for any legacy loading code.

---

## PHASE B — Enemy Expansion
> **Goal:** Meaningful enemy variety per zone/dungeon, Zelda-style encounter design. All enemies use `buildEnemy(dna)` — no GLB models, no external packs.

### B1 — Procedural Enemy System (replaces old model loading)
- [x] `src/enemy-creator/types.ts` — `EnemyDNA` with species, combatRole, tier, colors, weapon, movement
- [x] `src/enemy-creator/builder.ts` — `buildEnemy(dna)` → procedural rig, zero GLB dependency
- [x] `src/enemy-creator/defaults/EnemyDefaults.ts` — default enemies per floor tier + boss defaults
- [x] `src/enemy/EnemyLoader.ts` — `loadEnemyById()` falls back to `buildProceduralEnemyRig(dna)` for all IDs
- [ ] **PROC-E2:** Remove `ENEMY_MANIFEST`, `charManifest.ts` enemy entries, all `loadEnemyModel()` / GLB load paths (tracked in PROC-E)

### B2 — Enemy Roster by Zone
> All enemies built procedurally via `buildEnemy(dna)`. DNA specifies species, combatRole, tier, colors, movement — no external models.

#### Tower Dungeon (Floors B1–9)
| Enemy | Species DNA | Floor Range | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Bone Warrior** | undead · melee | B1–2 | 1 | Basic melee, telegraphed swing |
| **Bone Archer** | undead · ranged | B1–3 | 1 | Ranged, seeks cover |
| **Rot Walker** | undead · melee | B1–2 | 1 | Slow, heavy hit, fear aura |
| **Imp Skulk** | draconic · swarm | 2–4 | 1 | Fast, low HP, swarms |
| **Slime Cube** | slime · melee | 1–3 | 1 | Splits on death |
| **Stone Golem** | draconic · tank | 4–6 | 2 | High HP, slow, area stomp |
| **Gargoyle** | draconic · melee | 5–7 | 2 | Dive bomb, perch behaviour |
| **Shadow Caster** | undead · caster | 5–8 | 2 | Ranged spells, teleports |
| **Fae Wraith** | fae · caster | 7–8 | 2 | Teleports, charm debuff |
| **Vampire Skulk** | vampire · caster | 8–9 | 3 | Life-steal, mist form |
| **Brute** | orcish · melee | 6–8 | 2 | Charge attack, cleave |
| **Spectral Knight** | undead · tank | 8–9 | 3 | Phase, reflects spells |
| **Drake Whelp** | draconic · caster | 9 | 3 | Fire cone, boss encounter |

#### Overworld (Exterior)
| Enemy | Species DNA | Biome | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Scout** | orcish · melee | Forest | 1 | Patrol path, flees at low HP |
| **Troll** | orcish · tank | Forest/Highland | 2 | Regenerates, stunned by fire |
| **Spider** | draconic · swarm | Bog | 1 | Webs player (slow debuff) |
| **Bat Swarm** | fae · swarm | Cave/Dungeon entry | 1 | Multi-hit, spread formation |
| **Bog Wraith** | undead · caster | Bog | 2 | Invisible until 10u range |
| **Bandit** | human · melee | Road/Camp | 1 | Ranged + melee, has camp |
| **Baron Guard** | human · tank | Baron's Keep | 2 | Organised formation, shielded |

### B3 — Dungeon Encounter Design (Zelda-style)
> Each room has a designed encounter archetype. Rooms clear (enemies stop spawning) once all enemies die.

| Room Type | Encounter Pattern | Enemy Combo Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Entry room** | 2–3 tier-1 enemies, spread placement | 2× Skeleton Warrior |
| **Patrol room** | 4 enemies on patrol paths, alert on sight | 2× Skeleton + 2× Imp |
| **Ambush room** | Room appears empty; enemies spawn from corners on entry | 4× Zombie rise from floor |
| **Ranged gauntlet** | 2 archers elevated + 2 melee blocking path | 2× Skeleton Archer + 2× Slime |
| **Elite room** | 1 tier-2 enemy + 2 tier-1 support | Golem + 2× Skeleton |
| **Swarm room** | 8–12 tier-1 enemies spawn in waves | 3 waves of 4× Imp |
| **Puzzle room** | Enemies locked behind pressure-plate gates, must be activated in order | — |
| **Boss room** | 1 tier-3 boss + periodic minion spawns | Dragon Whelp + wave Skeletons |

- [x] `RoomEncounterDef.ts`: typed structure `{pattern, tier, enemies[], waveCount?, spawnPositions?}` — **done.** 8 encounter pools (floors 1–2, 4–9) with all archetypes from the table above.
- [x] `TowerFloorDef.ts`: each floor gets `encounterPool: RoomEncounterDef[]` — **done.** All combat floors wired.
- [x] `SceneManager.ts`: on room enter, reads encounter def → seeds enemy selection by room ID → spawns enemies (currently falls back to SlimeEnemy stand-in until `EnemyLoader.ts` lands)
- [x] Wave spawner: for swarm rooms, spawn next wave after N kills (configurable `waveKillThreshold`) — `_waveState` in `SceneManager.ts`, validated in `RoomEncounterDef.ts`, 7 unit tests in `tests/levels/waveSpawner.test.ts`
- [x] Room-cleared reward: glowing orb spawned at room centre on all-enemies-dead — `_spawnClearReward()` in `SceneManager.ts`; proximity pickup (1.2 WU) fires `onRewardOrbPickup` callback
- [x] Room-cleared reward: glowing orb spawned at room centre — `SceneManager._spawnClearReward()`, proximity pickup (1.2 WU), `onRewardOrbPickup` callback, auto-removes after 18s
- [x] **Unit test:** `tests/levels/encounterDef.test.ts` — 32 tests: all pools valid, wave counts sensible, boss on floor 9 only, TowerFloorDef wiring
- [ ] **Playwright:** Enter ambush room → all enemies spawn → kill all → room-cleared chest appears → interact → loot

### B4 — Enemy AI Pass
- [x] Tier-1 melee: `PatrolThenChase` FSM (`src/enemy/PatrolBehavior.ts`) — patrol waypoints → 8u detect → alert (shout) → chase → melee attack with cooldown. `setPatrolBehavior(opts)` on `SlimeEnemy` enables patrol for an encounter.
- [x] Tier-1 ranged: `StationaryShootBehavior` (`src/enemy/PatrolBehavior.ts`) — alert → aim → shoot on cooldown (foundation; full projectile hookup in D-phase).
- [x] Tier-2: `TacticalBrute` — melee + special ability (25s CD stomp), retreat-to-heal at <20% HP — `TacticalBrute` class in `PatrolBehavior.ts`
- [ ] Elite/Boss: bespoke per-enemy behaviour tree (see game-ai skill)
- [x] Death model fade: `_modelFadeTimer` on SlimeEnemy drives attached `EnemyRig` mesh opacity from 1→0 over 1.5s via `_driveRigAnimation` in SceneManager. Death also plays `rig.clips.death` clip.
- [x] Aggro system: `AggroSystem` singleton (`src/enemy/AggroSystem.ts`) — enemies register on spawn, unregister on death. `shout(shouter)` broadcasts detection to all listeners within 8u radius, rate-limited to 1 shout per 2s per enemy.
- [x] EnemyRig animation driven by SlimeEnemy FSM state: idle→`idle`, chase→`run`, attack→`attack`, dead→`death` (fuzzy clip-name matching, graceful null fallback).
- [x] SceneManager: patrol encounters generate room-corner waypoints; patrol enemies spawn with offset waypoint start for varied patrol loops. AggroSystem cleared on room teardown.
- [x] **Unit test:** `tests/enemy/enemyAI.test.ts` — 21 tests: all FSM state transitions with mocked player distances, AggroSystem broadcast radius + rate-limit + clearAll

---

## PHASE C — Quest Lines (Species + General)
> **Goal:** 5 fully implemented, lore-correct, non-generic quests per species + 5 general quests. Each has: intro dialogue, 2–4 beats, unique reward, resolution text.

### C1 — Quest Architecture
- [x] Extend `StoryQuestLine.ts` beat types: `read_lore` ✅, `talk_to_npc` ✅, `defeat_elite` ✅, `reach_location` ✅, `craft_item` ✅
- [x] `QuestReward` type: `{xp, itemId?, spellId?, statBonus?, unlockZone?, label}` — added to `StoryQuestLine.ts`
- [x] `StoryRunner.ts`: `StoryTickState` extended with `completedNpcDialogues: ReadonlySet<string>` and `eliteEnemiesKilled: ReadonlySet<string>`; all beat types handle the new objectives
- [x] `QuestJournal.ts`: extends `QuestLog` — separate species-quests tab (story_ prefix) from world-quests tab; `[J]` key opens, click tab to switch, `setSpeciesTitle()` sets the story arc name
- [x] Quest-giver NPCs: 3 archetypes placed procedurally — `quest_giver` in VILLAGE/TOWN/CITY role lists, `settlement_elder` in TOWN/CITY, `mysterious` auto-spawns at each ruin with dedicated greeting + quest-hint banks

## PHASE E — Act I Story Arcs + Solmor Encounter
> **Selected from TODO.md as the 2 most gameplay-impactful pending phases.**
> These two complete the narrative backbone that turns the alpha into a *game* rather than a demo.

### E1 — Act I Species Story Arcs (full implementation)

Each Act I arc is 4 beats (same beat infra as prologue) with a proper dramatic arc and species-specific flavour. Uses the new beat types from Phase C1.

| Species | Arc Title | Arc Summary | New Beat Types Used |
|---|---|---|---|
| Human | **Raiders on the Rise** | A war band has been raiding settlements. She realises they're following orders from someone with access to tower knowledge. The trail leads to one of Solmor's "previous candidates" gone rogue. | `defeat_elite`, `reach_location`, `talk_to_npc` |
| Undead | **Why Am I Moving?** | She finds a lore-book in a dungeon that describes the mechanism of her own undeath. The mechanism has a maintenance point — down in the bog shrine. | `read_lore`, `reach_location`, `survive_wave` |
| Vulperia | **Someone Wants You Dead** | A bounty hunter finds her on floor 3. The contract originated from within the Baron's Keep. She must infiltrate, find the issuer, and decide: kill, blackmail, or expose. | `reach_location`, `defeat_elite`, `talk_to_npc` |
| Slime | **What Is This?** | She absorbs something she shouldn't. A dormant personality fragment of the previous slime candidate surfaces. The fragment knows a way out that isn't the front door. | `read_lore`, `interact_key` (secret door), `survive_wave` |

- [x] Write full beat dialogue + completion text for all 4 arcs — **existing content in `StoryQuestLine.ts`** covers all 4 species with Act I–IV beats each
- [x] `read_lore` beat type: `BookReader.ts` fires → `_booksReadCount` increments → `StoryRunner.tick()` checks delta since beat start ✓
- [x] `talk_to_npc` beat type: `NPCEntity.ts` wired → `completedNpcDialogues` set → `StoryRunner.tick()` checks ✓ (E1/C1)
- [x] `defeat_elite` beat type: enemy `group.userData['enemyId']` → `_eliteEnemiesKilled` set (populated each frame when kills increase) → `StoryRunner.tick()` checks ✓
- [x] Place 4 Act I lore books in appropriate dungeon rooms via `chamberScatter` lecterns:
  - Human arc ledger: Floor 3 (Wizard's Chambers) — raiders with inside info
  - Vulperia arc contract: Floor 4 (Runic Forge) — bounty on fox-eared candidate
  - Undead arc maintenance notes: Floor 5 (Minion Barracks) — suppression ward degrading
  - Slime arc incident report: Floor 7 (Botanical Lab) — previous slime absorbed a personality fragment

- [x] `SolmorDialogueTree.ts`: 3-stage species-aware dialogue tree with full written content, localStorage stage tracking, `showSolmorEncounter(stage, species, onComplete)` modal with E-to-advance keyboard, Stage 3 choice buttons → stores `tt3_solmor_choice_s3`
- [x] `main.ts`: `onExitTrigger` checks `_towerPrologueDone && getSolmorStage() < 1` → fires Stage 1 on first tower exit; resets on new game. Stage 1 dialogue: surprised-businesslike, tries to hire, reveals he's been watching.
- [x] Stage 2 dialogue: candid, explains ascension cycle research, acknowledges failures. Stage 3 dialogue: full vulnerability, the "what do you want to do with what you are?" choice.

- [x] **Unit test:** `LockedDoor` — `tests/interactables/lockedDoor.test.ts` (4 tests: callback fires, out-of-range, multi-door nearest, missing content defaults)

---

## PHASE F — Testing Suite
> **Goal:** Every phase's work is covered by automated tests. Alpha ships with a fully green test suite.

### F1 — Unit Tests (`vitest`)

### F3 — Playwright Playtests (automated E2E)
> Playwright runs against `vite preview` on localhost; screenshots saved to `test-results/screenshots/`

- [x] `tests/e2e/startup.spec.ts` — 7 tests: page loads without errors, canvas visible, __game present, startGame works, getPlayerPos/getGameMode/setGameSpeed APIs
- [x] `tests/e2e/campfire-intro.spec.ts` — 8 tests: overlay opens, char grid, state API, 4-species startGame, boon cards, name input, stress open/close, deterministic seed
- [ ] `tests/e2e/campfire-intro.spec.ts` — Full 4 species × 4 choice branches (needs campfire flow wiring)
- [x] `tests/e2e/tower-prologue.spec.ts` — 7 tests: game starts on F0, teleport, room transition, getCurrentFloor, story beat, Escape pause, HUD visible, no errors during movement

- [x] All specs: `page.on('pageerror')` capture baked in

### F4 — Browser Dev Console Feedback
- [x] `vite.config.ts`: `logLevel: 'warn'` for production builds, `'info'` for dev (uses `defineConfig(({ mode }) => ...)`)
- [x] Playwright specs: each test captures `page.on('pageerror')` + `console.error` — `attachErrorCapture(page)` + `screenshotAndAssertClean()` added to `tests/e2e/helpers.ts`; startup spec migrated
- [x] `window.onerror` handler in `index.html` — posts to `/_dev/error` in dev; Vite plugin handles the endpoint
- [ ] Weekly: run `npx vite build && npx vite preview` + full Playwright suite on CI

---

## PHASE G — Polish, Performance & UI/UX HUD
> **Goal:** The alpha feels finished. Controls are crisp. HUD communicates clearly. Framerate is smooth on mid-range hardware.

### G1 — Performance
- [ ] **Frame budget audit:** Profile with Chrome DevTools. Target: 60fps on M1 / GTX 1060 equivalent
- [ ] `InstancedMesh` for all repeated environment (trees, rocks, dungeon tiles): batch count per scene ≤ 300 draw calls
- [ ] LOD system: procedural building/tree geometry gets simplified LOD at 50u+ — lower polygon counts via `THREE.LOD` at coarse `BuildingDNA.size`
- [ ] Texture atlasing: pack all small dungeon prop textures into a 2048×2048 atlas, reduce material count
- [x] Physics culling: `PhysicsWorld.ts` — `cullingRadius`/`cullingOrigin`; `step()` disables fixed bodies beyond 30u before Rapier solve, re-enables after; wired in `main.ts`
- [x] Spawn pooling: enemy `THREE.Group` objects pooled (max 30 live) — `SceneManager._acquireEnemy()` + `_returnToPool()` + `SlimeEnemy.revive()`
- [ ] Memory leak audit: run Chrome heap snapshot before and after 5-minute play session; diff > 50MB = fix
- [ ] **Unit test (perf guard):** `OverworldScene` with 500 instanced trees renders in < 16ms (mocked RAF)

### G2 — UI/UX Pass
- [x] HUD health bar: animated HP tick-down — `HUD.ts` `_displayedHp` lerp (200ms delay + smooth fill)
- [x] HUD spell glyphs: cooldown fill animation + number countdown — ability bar handles all 4 slots
- [x] Minimap: overworld only — `OWMinimap.ts`, canvas minimap in top-right, player dot + explored fog-of-war, toggle [M]
- [x] Quest tracker: show active quest name + current beat objective in bottom-right (collapsible) — `HUD.setQuestTracker({ title, beat })`, click to collapse, `null` to hide
- [x] Damage numbers: floating text pops on hit — `DamageNumbers.ts`, wired in `main.ts` (damage=red, heal=green, crit=large yellow)
- [x] Enemy health bars: thin bar above enemy head, visible within 15u — `EnemyHealthBars.ts`, wired in `main.ts`
- [x] Interaction prompt: `[E] Interact` label — `InteractableSystem.ts` world prompt; `NPCEntity.ts` interact-range detection
- [x] Screen-space hit flash: brief white vignette when player takes damage — `hud.flashHit()` CSS pulse in `HUD.ts`
- [x] Low HP warning: HUD border pulses red below 25% HP — `hud-low-hp-overlay` CSS keyframe in `HUD.ts`
- [x] Death screen: full-screen fade + "You Fell" text + Respawn / Load buttons — `DeathScreen.ts`, wired in `main.ts`
- [x] Loading screen: floor name title card shown at peak-black during room transitions — `SceneManager.ts` floor title card with Solmor quote slot

### G3 — Game Feel Polish
> Uses game-feel skill techniques

- [x] Screen shake on heavy melee hit + explosion + player death — `CameraRig.shake()`, called in `main.ts` at all impact events
- [x] Hit stop: 3-frame freeze on heavy hits — `gameLoop.freeze(2)` called in `main.ts` on hit events
- [x] Dodge roll: squash on launch (scale Y: 0.7), stretch at peak speed (scale Z: 1.3), land bounce — `PlayerController.ts` squash/stretch system on `bodyMesh`
- [x] Spell cast: camera FOV / zoom punch on fire — `CameraRig.zoomPunch()` called in `main.ts` on spell cast
- [x] Enemy death: dissolve shader (opacity 1→0 over 1.5s) + death clip — `_modelFadeTimer` on `SlimeEnemy`, driven in `SceneManager.ts` (knockback impulse pending)
- [x] Floor transition: wipe fade (0.4s) + floor name title card + ambient sound crossfade — `SceneManager.ts` fade transition with title card
- [x] Item pickup: radial glow pulse + pop scale animation — `src/ui/PickupVFX.ts` `spawnPickupVFX(scene, pos)`
- [x] Talent point unlock: particle burst + chime SFX — `src/ui/TalentUnlockVFX.ts`, wired into `TalentTree._tryBuy()`
- [ ] All SFX: final pass on timing, pitch variation ±8%, volume mix

### G4 — Controls & Accessibility
- [x] Keyboard rebinding: Settings → Controls tab — `InputManager.rebind()` wired to MainMenu `rebindControls` callbacks; persists to localStorage via `LS_BINDINGS_KEY`
- [ ] Gamepad support: left stick → WASD, right stick → look/aim, A/B/X/Y → action/dodge/interact/spell
- [x] Colour-blind mode: Settings toggle — `applyColourBlindMode()` in MainMenu replaces red/green with orange/blue; persists to localStorage
- [x] Text scale: Settings slider (80%–140%) — `applyTextScale()` in MainMenu; persists to localStorage
- [x] Subtitle captions for campfire dialogue — `FloatingDialogue3D._captionEl` DOM bar; on by default; `setCaptionsEnabled(bool)` toggle; persists to localStorage
- [ ] **Playwright:** Rebind one key, restart session, verify rebind persisted

---

### NS1 — New Story Arcs (3 × 4-act, 16 beats each)

#### 🧝 Elf Arc — *"The Second Time Around"*
She has been here before. Not this tower — a different one. A different wizard. A different century. She is less surprised than she should be, which says something.

| Act | Title | Summary | Beat Types |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prologue | *The Tower, Again* | The staircase layout is different. The books are in the wrong order. These are the only comforts. | `explore_floor`, `interact_key` |
| Act I | *Something Familiar* | A book in the library is annotated in her own handwriting. She doesn't remember writing it. | `read_lore`, `talk_to_npc` |
| Act II | *The Previous Candidate* | Evidence suggests Solmor has imprisoned an elf before — centuries ago. The records were sealed. She unseals them. | `reach_location`, `defeat_elite` |
| Act III/IV | *The Graceful Exit* | She could leave with the knowledge she came for. She chooses to stay long enough to make it inconvenient. | All types |

- [x] Write full beat dialogue + completion text for Elf Act I–IV (16 beats)
- [x] Elf staircase flavour text: 4 floors (basement/lib/brew/chambers)
- [x] Elf Solmor Stage 1/2 dialogue variants — politely unsurprised, annotated book question
- [x] Elf lore book placed in Floor 2 (Brewing) — recipe in her handwriting, 3 centuries old

#### ⭐ Celestial Arc — *"Atmospheric Re-entry"*
She fell. This happens. The tower was just where she landed. She has filed a formal complaint with the relevant cosmic authority and is waiting for a response.

| Act | Title | Summary | Beat Types |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prologue | *The Landing* | The tower is cold. The ceiling has three cracks. She has counted them. | `explore_floor`, `interact_key` |
| Act I | *Gravity* | Something about the tower's wards is specifically suppressing her celestial connection. This is unusual. This is personal. | `read_lore`, `talk_to_npc` |
| Act II | *The Anchor* | A ward stone on floor 7 is the source. It was placed within the last fifty years. By someone who knew exactly what it would do. | `reach_location`, `defeat_elite` |
| Act III/IV | *Reconnection* | Destroy the anchor, feel the stars again. Then decide how to handle Solmor. | All types |

- [x] Write full beat dialogue + completion text for Celestial Act I–IV (16 beats)
- [x] Celestial staircase flavour text (4 floors)
- [x] Celestial Solmor Stage 1/2 variants — light discomfort, ward paper page 14
- [x] Celestial lore book placed in Floor 8 (Archive) — ward paper with her gold-star addendum

#### 🐉 Draconic Arc — *"The Fire That Stays"*
She isn't angry. She is very patient. The scales absorbing the wizard's ambient spellwork are a side effect; so is the faint smell of ozone. She has decided not to explain either.

| Act | Title | Summary | Beat Types |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prologue | *Heat Retention* | The tower is cooler than expected. The books are not fire-resistant. She adjusts. | `explore_floor`, `interact_key` |
| Act I | *The Hoard Instinct* | She keeps finding rooms she wants to claim. This is apparently cultural. She is documenting it. | `read_lore`, `reach_location` |
| Act II | *Old Claim* | The land the tower stands on was once draconic territory — several centuries ago. There are plaques. | `talk_to_npc`, `defeat_elite` |
| Act III/IV | *Reclamation* | She does not want the tower. She wants it acknowledged that she could take the tower. These are different. | All types |

- [x] Write full beat dialogue + completion text for Draconic Act I–IV (16 beats)
- [x] Draconic staircase flavour text (4 floors)
- [x] Draconic Solmor Stage 1/2 variants — sign suggestion, 3-day observation
- [x] Draconic lore book placed in Floor 4 (Runic Forge) — territorial treatise + sealed Appendix D

---

### NS5 — Species-Aware Solmor Encounters

The 3-stage Solmor dialogue tree needs branches for the 3 new Tier-1 species.

- [ ] **Elf — Stage 1:** He is confused — she seems completely unsurprised. She isn't. *"This is the third tower. The second wizard. You're the first to notice, which is either encouraging or more concerning."*
- [ ] **Celestial — Stage 1:** He is physically uncomfortable. She emits light. He tries to pretend this is normal. *"You're not what I was expecting."* / *"I know. I rarely am."*
- [ ] **Draconic — Stage 1:** He is trying to be professional but her scales have been absorbing his ambient spellwork for a week. *"You've been... uh... would you mind—"* / *"I'll stop absorbing it when you stop leaking it."*
- [x] `SolmorDialogueTree.ts` `showSolmorEncounter()` extended: accepts `species: SpeciesId` parameter (currently only uses 4 variants) — add `elf`, `celestial`, `draconic` branches for Stage 1/2/3
- [ ] Stage 3 choice text (the "what do you want to do with what you are?" question) gets species-specific answer options for all 7 species

---

### NS6 — New Lore Books & Environmental Storytelling

Each new Tier-1 species gets a species-specific lore book in the tower, distinct from the 4 currently placed.

- [ ] **Elf** — Floor 1 (Library): An annotated spellbook in her own handwriting from "about three hundred years ago." The handwriting is better. The margin notes are not.
- [ ] **Celestial** — Floor 7 (Botanical Lab, already has slime book): A paper titled *"Interim Report: Celestial Binding Efficacy at Ground Level"* with results marked **INCONCLUSIVE** in large letters.
- [ ] **Draconic** — Floor 9 (Observatory): A star chart with handwritten notes identifying three constellations as historically draconic territory claims. The notes are defensive.
- [ ] Implement via `chamberScatter` lectern entries on appropriate floors (matching the 3 new arcs)

## Phase PROC — Full Procedural Pivot: Retire External Assets, Build Creator Ecosystem

> **Decision (2026-07-18):** Move completely away from external asset packs. Code-first only. The procedural princess rig already proves the aesthetic works.
> We will build dedicated procedural tools for every entity type, plus a full modular
> world-building system, then retire the old GLB pipeline.

### Two consumers of every builder — this is the core principle

Every builder (NPC, Enemy, Prop, Building) serves **two equally important consumers**:

1. **The game itself** — the runtime procedural world generator uses these builders
   to populate settlements, generate dungeon rooms, spawn NPC crowds, place enemies
   in encounters, fill interiors with furniture, and decorate every space.
   No human involvement needed. The game runs `buildBuilding(dna)` and `buildNpc(dna)`
   automatically from world-gen scripts exactly like it already runs `buildPrincess(dna)`.

2. **The designer** — creative mode and the standalone atelier tools let a human
   author custom blueprints, tweak them in the visual editor, save them to a gallery,
   and place them in specific world locations. Custom blueprints override the
   procedural defaults for named locations (e.g. "the inn in Ravenport" is always
   Mirabel's custom inn blueprint, not a random one).

**The builder code is shared.** The atelier tools and the game runtime call the exact
same `build*(dna)` function. The atelier just adds a UI layer around it.

> **Implementation order:** PROC-A (foundation) → PROC-B (creator tools + game runtime wiring)
> → PROC-C (world gen system) → PROC-D (creative mode integration)
> → PROC-E (asset pipeline removal)

---

### PROC-A: Procedural Foundation & Registry

**Goal:** Single registry that maps entity type → procedural builder. Both the game runtime
and the atelier tools resolve builders through the same registry.

- [x] A1: `src/procedural/EntityRegistry.ts` — central map: `'princess' | 'npc' | 'enemy' | 'prop' | 'building'` → builder factory; game systems import from here, not directly from builders
- [x] A2: `src/procedural/ProceduralDNA.ts` — shared base DNA interface with `v`, `seed`, `name`, `kind` fields; species-specific DNA extends it
- [x] A3: `src/procedural/builder/BaseBuilder.ts` — abstract builder with `build(dna): THREE.Group`, `update(t, dt)`, `dispose()`
- [x] A4: Share code system extended to all entity types (`P2.` prefix for princess, `N2.` for NPC, `E2.` for enemy, `B2.` for building)
- [x] A5: `src/procedural/WorldGen.ts` — top-level world generation coordinator: given a world `seed`, produces a deterministic placement plan for all buildings, NPCs, enemies, and props in a region
- [x] A6: `tests/procedural/EntityRegistry.test.ts` — registry resolves all known types without error
- [x] A7: `tests/procedural/WorldGen.test.ts` — same seed → identical placement plan every run

---

### PROC-B: Creator Tool Ecosystem

**Goal:** Each builder has two entry points:
- A **standalone atelier** (HTML tool) for human authoring and blueprint saving
- A **game-runtime API** called by the world generator and scene loading code

Both call the same underlying `build*(dna)` function.

#### B1: NPC Creator Atelier + Game Runtime (`npc-creator.html`)

**Atelier:** designer opens tool, chooses species/role/personality, tweaks appearance,
saves blueprint to gallery. Named NPCs in specific towns can be locked to a blueprint.

**Game runtime:** `NPCSpawner.spawnForSettlement(settlement, seed)` reads the settlement
DNA, picks NPC roles from the population table, resolves each role to either a named
blueprint (if one exists for that location) or generates one procedurally from the role
+ species defaults. Calls `buildNpc(dna)` and places the result in the scene.

- [x] B1a: `src/npc-creator/types.ts` — `NpcDNA` with fields: `species`, `role` (merchant | elder | quest_giver | scholar | guard | innkeeper | mysterious), `personality` (friendly | wary | eccentric | formal | cheerful), `bodyPreset`, `colors`, `accessory`, `dialogue_seed`
- [x] B1b: `src/npc-creator/builder.ts` — `buildNpc(dna)` → `NpcInstance` with `.root`, `.update(t,dt)`, `.speak(text)`, `.idle()`; called by BOTH the atelier preview AND the game's NPCSpawner
- [x] B1c: `src/npc-creator/archetypes/` — 6 species archetypes (human, undead, foxling, slime, elf, draconic) each with 3 role variants
- [x] B1d: `src/npc-creator/ui.ts` — Atelier UI: role picker, species wheel, color swatches, name generator, accessory slots (hat, badge, bag, tool)
- [x] B1e: `npc-creator.html` — standalone entry point; save to `ttt.npcCreator.gallery.v1` localStorage
- [x] B1f: `src/npc-creator/gallery.ts` — load/save/delete NPC blueprints, share codes
- [x] B1g: `src/npc-creator/defaults/NpcDefaults.ts` — 6 default NPC blueprints (one per species, role=merchant); used by NPCSpawner when no custom blueprint exists
- [x] B1h: `src/world/NPCSpawner.ts` refactor — `spawnForSettlement(settlementDna, seed)` resolves NPC list from population tier; calls `buildNpc(dna)` for every NPC; no more `loadCharModel()`
- [x] B1i: `src/world/NPCSpawner.ts` — named NPC override system: `NAMED_NPCS: Record<locationId, NpcDNA>` allows specific blueprint per named location
- [x] B1j: Tests — `tests/npc-creator/defaults.test.ts`, `tests/npc-creator/builder.test.ts`, `tests/npc-creator/spawner.test.ts`

#### B2: Enemy Creator Atelier + Game Runtime (`enemy-creator.html`)

**Atelier:** designer creates enemy blueprints by tier and role, tests them in a built-in
combat arena with a dummy player. Saves to enemy gallery.

**Game runtime:** `EnemyLoader.loadForEncounter(encounterId, floor, seed)` reads the
encounter definition, resolves enemy types to blueprints (named boss blueprints for
boss rooms, procedural tier-appropriate blueprints for random encounters), calls
`buildEnemy(dna)`, and hands the result to the combat system.

- [x] B2a: `src/enemy-creator/types.ts` — `EnemyDNA` with: `species`, `combatRole` (melee | ranged | caster | support | tank | swarm), `tier` (1–3), `bodyPreset`, `colors`, `weapon`, `ability`, `movementStyle` (patrol | charge | circle | ambush), `aggroRange`, `attackRange`
- [x] B2b: `src/enemy-creator/builder.ts` — `buildEnemy(dna)` → `EnemyInstance`; called by BOTH the atelier preview arena AND the game's EnemyLoader at room load time
- [x] B2c: `src/enemy-creator/archetypes/` — 5 combat archetypes: Brute, Skulk, Hexer, Warden, Swarmling — each buildable for any species
- [x] B2d: `src/enemy-creator/ui.ts` — Atelier UI: combat role picker, tier dial, weapon slot, ability slot, test arena with dummy player
- [x] B2e: `enemy-creator.html` — standalone entry; save to `ttt.enemyCreator.gallery.v1`
- [x] B2f: `src/enemy-creator/defaults/EnemyDefaults.ts` — default enemies per floor tier (floors 0–9 + basement); used by EnemyLoader for random encounters when no custom blueprint specified
- [x] B2g: `src/enemy/EnemyLoader.ts` refactor — `loadForEncounter()` reads encounter definition, resolves enemy list, calls `buildEnemy(dna)`; fully replaces old KayKit skeleton/zombie model loading
- [x] B2h: Boss enemies — `EnemyDNA.tier = 4` flag; boss creator tab in enemy atelier; boss blueprints stored as named entries (`boss_floor3`, `boss_floor7`, etc.)
- [x] B2i: Tests — `tests/enemy-creator/defaults.test.ts`, `tests/enemy-creator/builder.test.ts`, `tests/enemy-creator/encounter.test.ts`

#### B3: Prop & Item Creator + Game Runtime (`prop-creator.html`)

**Atelier:** designer creates prop blueprints (chests, furniture, dungeon dressing),
previews them in 3D, saves to gallery.

**Game runtime:** `PropPlacer.decorateRoom(roomDna, seed)` reads the room's floor theme,
queries the prop gallery for theme-appropriate blueprints, calls `buildProp(dna)` for
each, and scatters them within the room bounds using the room's placement grid.
This runs automatically every time a dungeon room is loaded.

- [x] B3a: `src/prop-creator/types.ts` — `PropDNA` with: `kind` (chest | bookshelf | table | chair | cauldron | lantern | pillar | rug | door | statue | barrel | crate), `material` (stone | wood | bone | crystal | iron | clay), `size`, `colors`, `glow`, `interactive`, `theme` (dungeon | library | alchemy | overworld | residential)
- [x] B3b: `src/prop-creator/builder.ts` — `buildProp(dna)` → `THREE.Group` with collision metadata + optional interaction zone; called by BOTH atelier preview AND PropPlacer at room-load time
- [x] B3c: 12 base prop archetypes with material and theme variants
- [x] B3d: `prop-creator.html` — standalone tool; drag-and-drop placement preview
- [x] B3e: `src/levels/PropPlacer.ts` — `decorateRoom(roomDna, seed)` queries prop gallery by theme, places props using seeded RNG; called by SceneManager after room geometry is built
- [x] B3f: Room floor themes drive prop palette: ground=study, 1=library, 2=lab, 3=observatory, basement=alchemy, settlement=residential
- [x] B3g: Tests — `tests/prop-creator/builder.test.ts`, `tests/levels/PropPlacer.test.ts`
- [x] B1g: `src/npc-creator/defaults/NpcDefaults.ts` — 6 default NPC blueprints (one per species, role=merchant)
- [x] B1h: `src/world/NPCSpawner.ts` updated — reads NPC blueprints from registry; `buildNpc(dna)` replaces old procedural DNA creature rig for all NPCs
- [x] B1i: Tests — `tests/npc-creator/defaults.test.ts`, `tests/npc-creator/builder.test.ts`

#### B2: Enemy Creator Atelier (`enemy-creator.html`)

The enemy creator focuses on combat role, threat level, and attack patterns — not story.

- [x] B2a: `src/enemy-creator/types.ts` — `EnemyDNA` with: `species`, `combatRole` (melee | ranged | caster | support | tank | swarm), `tier` (1–3), `bodyPreset`, `colors`, `weapon`, `ability`, `movementStyle` (patrol | charge | circle | ambush), `aggroRange`, `attackRange`
- [x] B2b: `src/enemy-creator/builder.ts` — `buildEnemy(dna)` → `EnemyInstance` with `.root`, `.update(t,dt)`, `.attack()`, `.takeDamage(n)`, `.die()`
- [x] B2c: `src/enemy-creator/archetypes/` — 5 combat archetypes: Brute, Skulk, Hexer, Warden, Swarmling — each buildable for any species
- [x] B2d: `src/enemy-creator/ui.ts` — Atelier UI: combat role picker, tier dial, weapon slot, ability slot, test arena with dummy player
- [x] B2e: `enemy-creator.html` — standalone entry; save to `ttt.enemyCreator.gallery.v1`
- [x] B2f: `src/enemy-creator/defaults/EnemyDefaults.ts` — default enemies per floor tier (floors 0–9 + basement)
- [x] B2g: `src/enemy/EnemyLoader.ts` updated — `loadEnemyById()` reads from enemy gallery + defaults; fully replaces old KayKit skeleton/zombie models
- [x] B2h: Boss enemies — `EnemyDNA.tier = 4` flag; boss creator tab in enemy atelier with custom phase definitions
- [x] B2i: Tests — `tests/enemy-creator/defaults.test.ts`, `tests/enemy-creator/builder.test.ts`, `tests/enemy-creator/combat.test.ts`

#### B3: Prop & Item Creator (`prop-creator.html`)

Furniture, interactables, treasure, dungeon dressing — all procedural.

- [x] B3a: `src/prop-creator/types.ts` — `PropDNA` with: `kind` (chest | bookshelf | table | chair | cauldron | lantern | pillar | rug | door | statue | barrel | crate), `material` (stone | wood | bone | crystal | iron | clay), `size`, `colors`, `glow`, `interactive`
- [x] B3b: `src/prop-creator/builder.ts` — `buildProp(dna)` → `THREE.Group` with collision metadata
- [x] B3c: 12 base prop archetypes with material variants
- [x] B3d: `prop-creator.html` — standalone tool; drag-and-drop placement preview
- [x] B3e: Room encounter definitions updated to reference prop blueprints instead of hardcoded geometry

---

### PROC-C: Procedural World Building System

**Goal:** Houses, buildings, dungeons, and interiors generated from modular DNA blueprints
at **runtime by the game** — not hand-placed. The same `buildBuilding(dna)` function
powers both the game's automatic world generation and the designer's creative mode placement.

When the game generates a new overworld region it calls:
```
WorldGen.generateSettlement(seed, settlementDna)
  → BuildingBuilder.build(buildingDna)          // exterior mesh
  → InteriorGenerator.build(interiorLayoutDna)  // interior rooms
  → PropPlacer.decorateRoom(roomDna, seed)       // furniture + props
  → NPCSpawner.spawnForSettlement(...)           // NPC crowd
```
All of this runs automatically from seeds — no human input required.
A designer using creative mode calls the same chain, but picks the DNAs manually.

#### C1: Modular Building Grammar

- [x] C1a: `src/world/buildings/BuildingDNA.ts` — `BuildingDNA` with: `kind` (house | shop | inn | guild | tower | ruin | barn | well | gate), `size` (tiny | small | medium | large), `floors` (1–3), `style` (thatched | stone | timber | arcane), `condition` (pristine | weathered | damaged | ruined), `has_interior: boolean`, `interior_layout`
- [x] C1b: `src/world/buildings/ModularSet.ts` — vocabulary of reusable geometry pieces: wall segment, door frame, window, roof pitch, corner post, chimney, step, arch — all built from `THREE.BufferGeometry` primitives with material variants
- [x] C1c: `src/world/buildings/BuildingBuilder.ts` — `buildBuilding(dna): BuildingInstance` with `.exteriorGroup`, `.interiorGroup`, `.doorTrigger`, `.bounds`
- [x] C1d: Roof system — hip / gable / thatched variants, auto-fit to footprint
- [x] C1e: Window and door placement — rule-based: one door per street-facing wall, windows every N units
- [x] C1f: Facade decoration — shutters, hanging signs, flower boxes, barrels at door — driven by `style` + `condition`

#### C2: Settlement Generator

- [x] C2a: `src/world/SettlementGenerator.ts` refactor — replaces current placeholder; lays out buildings on a grid using BuildingDNA, respects roads/paths
- [x] C2b: `SettlementDNA` — `{ size: 'hamlet'|'village'|'town'|'city', style, factionId, populationTier }`; generates building mix from population tier
- [x] C2c: Road system — stone/dirt path procedural geometry connecting all buildings
- [x] C2d: Public spaces — market square, well, notice board, fountain — placed by role
- [x] C2e: Lighting — procedural lantern placement along roads + building windows at night

#### C3: Interior Generation

- [x] C3a: `src/world/buildings/InteriorGenerator.ts` — takes `BuildingDNA.interior_layout` and generates: floor plan, room dividers, furniture placement (using PropDNA blueprints), lighting
- [x] C3b: Interior layouts by building kind:
  - House: main room + bedroom + optional cellar
  - Inn: common room + bar + 4–8 sleeping rooms upstairs
  - Shop: counter + display shelves + back storage
  - Guild: hall + meeting room + armoury/library
  - Ruin: collapsed walls, debris, loot spawn points
- [x] C3c: Furniture density by `condition` — pristine rooms are tidy, ruined rooms have overturned/destroyed versions
- [x] C3d: Door trigger → load interior scene (reuses SceneManager room system)
- [x] C3e: Interior ambient: candles, fireplace, dust particles — all procedural

#### C4: Dungeon Generation Enhancement

- [ ] C4a: Tile vocabulary expanded — corridor segment, junction, dead end, alcove, large chamber, trapped floor, magical circle — all procedural geometry
- [ ] C4b: Wall decoration system — torches, chains, reliefs, carvings — placed by floor theme and condition
- [ ] C4c: Floor themes per tower level (ground=study, 1=library, 2=laboratory, 3=observatory, basement=workshop) drive prop palette selection
- [ ] C4d: Procedural ceiling system — arches, vaulted, flat — vary by room type
- [ ] C4e: Loot container placement — chests, crates, shelves — rule-based by room type

---

### PROC-D: Creative Mode Integration

**Goal:** All creator tools accessible from creative mode. World editor gains building placement.

- [ ] D1: Creative mode sidebar — new "🧪 Creators" section with links to NPC, Enemy, Prop creator tools
- [ ] D2: World editor — "🏠 Place Building" mode: pick building blueprint from gallery, click to place in overworld, auto-generates interior
- [ ] D3: World editor — "👤 Place NPC" mode: pick NPC blueprint, click to place, set patrol route
- [ ] D4: World editor — "💀 Place Enemy" mode: pick enemy blueprint, click to place, set encounter zone
- [ ] D5: Prop placement in interiors — creative mode within interior scenes lets designers place props from gallery
- [ ] D6: Blueprint export — save entire settlement as a JSON "world blueprint" that the procedural generator can replay deterministically
- [ ] D7: Test arena — enemy creator has built-in arena: place a player dummy, place enemy blueprints, run combat simulation

---

### PROC-E: Asset Pipeline Retirement

**Goal:** Surgically remove all GLB/FBX/asset-loader code paths. The game ships with zero binary model files. Every visual is generated from `THREE.BufferGeometry` primitives at runtime.

> **Audit result (2026-07-18):** The following source files contain asset/model references that need retirement.
> Completed PROC-A through PROC-C3 means all game systems now have procedural equivalents.

#### E1: Delete Dead HTML Tools

- [ ] E1a: Delete `src/model-review.ts` + `model-review.html` — KayKit/GLB inspector, no longer needed
- [ ] E1b: Delete `src/assetViewer.ts` + `asset-viewer.html` — asset browser, replaced by showroom
- [ ] E1c: Remove both from `vite.config.ts` `input` map
- [ ] E1d: `src/sandbox.ts` — remove all `assembleBuilding()` / `AssetBuildingAssembler` / `generateBuilding()` calls; replace building spawn with `buildBuilding(dna)` only
- [ ] **Test:** `npx vitest run` still passes; dev server starts without errors

#### E2: Retire Enemy Model Pipeline

- [ ] E2a: `src/characters/charManifest.ts` — remove all entries with `roles: ['enemy']` (replaced by `EnemyDefaults.ts`)
- [ ] E2b: `src/enemy/EnemyLoader.ts` — delete `ENEMY_MANIFEST`, `loadEnemyModel()`, `loadEnemyById()` GLB path; keep only the `buildProceduralEnemyRig(dna)` path
- [ ] E2c: `src/levels/RoomEncounterDef.ts` — remove `enemyId` strings that map to GLB charManifest entries; replace with `EnemyDNA` references
- [ ] E2d: `src/creative/backroomScenes.ts` — remove any enemy GLB spawn calls
- [ ] **Test:** `tests/levels/enemyLoader.test.ts` — update to cover procedural-only path; no 404s on any enemy ID

#### E3: Retire Player/NPC Asset Pipeline

- [ ] E3a: `src/characters/CharacterLoader.ts` — entire file retires after E2/E3; delete once no remaining callers
- [ ] E3b: `src/characters/CharacterController.ts` — KayKit animation bridge; retires with CharacterLoader
- [ ] E3c: `src/characters/AnimationRetargeter.ts` — GLB animation retargeting; delete after E3b
- [ ] E3d: `src/characters/charManifest.ts` — remove all player/NPC GLB entries (princess rig = procedural); file can be deleted once empty
- [ ] E3e: `src/characters/wizardManifest.ts` + `src/characters/WizardLoader.ts` — Solmor 3D presence; replace with procedural NPC rig (`buildNpc(dna)`)
- [ ] E3f: `src/player/PlayerController.ts` — remove `applyAssetModel()`, `_charController`, `_charLoader` fields; keep only `applyPrincess()` path
- [ ] E3g: `src/world/SolmorPresence.ts` — refactor to use `buildNpc(dna)` instead of GLB loading
- [ ] **Test:** `tests/player/PlayerController.test.ts` passes; no GLB imports in player code

#### E4: Retire Building / World Asset Pipeline

- [ ] E4a: `src/world/buildings/AssetBuildingAssembler.ts` — entire file retires; `buildBuilding(dna)` is the only building path
- [ ] E4b: `src/scene/OverworldScene.ts` — remove `upgradeBuildingsWithAssets()`, `upgradeDungeonEntrancesWithAssets()`, `upgradeTreesWithAssets()`, `upgradeRocksWithAssets()` and all `assetLoader` references
- [ ] E4c: `src/assets/AssetLoader.ts` — retire entirely once above callers are removed
- [ ] E4d: `src/assets/envManifest.ts` — retire (KayKit environment kit manifest)
- [ ] E4e: `src/world/WorldGenConfig.ts` — remove `KENNEY_PACKS`, `ASSET_PACKS`, asset pack toggle settings
- [ ] E4f: `src/rendering/KayKitDungeonProps.ts` — retire; dungeon props come from `buildProp(dna)` only
- [ ] **Test:** `OverworldScene` constructs without any async asset loads; world generates in < 100ms

#### E5: Retire Creative / Editor Asset Paths

- [ ] E5a: `src/creative/CreativeAssetBrowser.ts` — entire file retires; creative mode uses PROC-D creator tools
- [ ] E5b: `src/creative/CreativePlacementSystem.ts` — remove GLB placement path; keep procedural `buildBuilding(dna)` path only
- [ ] E5c: `src/creative/CreativeMode.ts` — remove asset loader initialization, `BUILDING_PRELOAD_PATHS`, all GLB preload calls
- [ ] E5d: `src/editor/BuildingEditor.ts`, `DungeonEditor.ts`, `EditorCore.ts` — remove all GLB/asset references; editors work with DNA blueprints only
- [ ] E5e: `src/ui/AssetCharBrowser.ts` — retire; character selection is princess creator + procedural NPCs
- [ ] E5f: `src/creative/Backrooms.ts` + `backroomScenes.ts` — remove the `asset_showcase` backroom; keep all procedural backrooms
- [ ] **Test:** Creative mode opens and all tools function without any model loading

#### E6: Wipe Public Asset Directories

- [ ] E6a: `public/assets/characters/` — delete all GLB/binary model files; keep only audio files if any
- [ ] E6b: `public/assets/environment/` — delete all GLB environment packs
- [ ] E6c: `public/draco/` — delete DRACO decoder (no longer needed without GLB)
- [ ] E6d: `public/assets/` — keep ONLY: `public/music/` (audio), `public/draco/` if still needed for something else
- [ ] E6e: Run `npm run build` — verify bundle size reduced by >50%; no 404 errors in Playwright tests
- [ ] **Test:** Full e2e suite passes; no console errors; `public/` < 10 MB total

#### E7: Final Architecture Cleanup

- [ ] E7a: `src/assetManifest.ts` — retire; replace any remaining callers with PROC registry
- [ ] E7b: `src/scene/CharacterDecisionTree.ts` — remove any `assetModel` path references
- [ ] E7c: `src/scene/NewGameFlow.ts` — remove GLB character loading from new game flow
- [ ] E7d: `src/ui/CharacterCreation.ts`, `CharacterCreationV2.ts`, `DNACreator.ts` — remove all GLB model preview/loading; use `buildPrincess(dna)` preview only
- [ ] E7e: `ARCHITECTURE.md` — rewrite character/enemy/NPC architecture section: DNA → builder → THREE.Group; remove all mentions of GLB pipeline
- [ ] E7f: All scripts in `scripts/` — delete `gen-char-manifest.mjs`, `gen-manifest.mjs`, `extract-char-assets.mjs`, `extract-wizards.mjs` (all GLB manifest generators)
- [ ] **Test:** `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; zero `import.*GLTFLoader` in `src/`

---

### PROC-F: Polish & Visual Upgrade (post-retirement)

**Goal:** With external assets gone, invest in procedural quality — the game should look *better*, not just different.

- [ ] F1: Princess rig — add more body shape presets, more dress variants, richer material system
- [ ] F2: NPC diversity — crowd-level variation: hat variants, cloak, apron, tool variety, 40+ combinations per role
- [ ] F3: Enemy visual tier — tier 1 enemies look scrappy, tier 2 look organised, tier 3 look terrifying — material + size + glow variation
- [ ] F4: Procedural ambient particles — dust motes, firefly-glow, ash, leaves, snow — environment-driven
- [ ] F5: Procedural lighting upgrade — every prop casts appropriate light; candle flicker, cauldron glow, moonlight through windows
- [ ] F6: Day/night visual transition — overworld buildings lit at night via procedural lantern system
- [ ] F7: Weather system (visual only) — rain particles, overcast sky, fog density — no gameplay impact
